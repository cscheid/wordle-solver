# wordle solver

There are many like it but this one is mine.

## word list

Beware: you can get the wordlist from the game source, but the words
are in chronological order and you _will_ spoil yourself unless you're
very careful!

On the other hand, @cfreshman provided a list of allowable guesses
that is sorted alphabetically so you don't have to worry about that.
