# wordle solver

There are many like it but this one is mine.

## word list

Beware: you can get the wordlist from the game source, but the words
are in chronological order and you _will_ spoil yourself unless you're
very careful!

And if you saw that one list of "allowed guesses" on github gists and you tried
to use it on 2022-01-17, congrats: you just got trolled too :( the list appears
to be missing all of the actual wordle solutions.

So I put together a [list](wordle-sorted-words.txt) that actually has
all allowed guesses _and_ solutions in it, sorted alphabetically so
you're not spoiled.

Feel free to use it.
